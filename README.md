## Building AI Agents over the weekend 
####  PacktPub / June 2025

## Glossary
| # | Abbreviation | Term                              | 
| - | ------------ | --------------------------------- | 
| 1 |  CVE         | Common Vulerability Exposure      |
| 2 |  EPSS        | Exploit Prediction Scoring System |


## Problem Statement
```
Automate the prioritization of the most recent vulnerabilities (CVEs) reported by NIST using the EPSS and enable Securitty teams to address the remediation of recent vulnerabilities with focused and timely remediation.
```
#### Notes
1. There may be recent CVEs whose status is `Awaiting Analysis` : Security teams can proatively watch the CVEs and remediate when the analysis is completed by NIST.
2. This prioritazation helps timely remediation of CVEswhich improves the overall compliance with Security Audits.

## AI Agent Function:
The AI agent conducts realtime data ingestion from NIST (with API key) and enriches the data from EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) followed by conducting `asset impact`  and finally `auto-prioritizes` in realtime the  CVes for efficient remediation downstream.
